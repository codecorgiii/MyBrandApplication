- [AAPT2](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/aapt2) (Android Asset Packaging Tool) is used by Android Studio and the Android Gradle Plugin to compile and package an app's resources.
  - Generates a unique integer ID for each resource under `/res`. These unique ID's are written to the R class generated bytecode as static constants where they can be accessed from application code. Example: `R.color.purple_500`
  - AAPT takes these generated unique ID's and their corresponding resource and compiles them into a binary format optimized for the Android platform. One of the files generated from this compilation step is the Resource table (resources.arsc in the application's APK). The Resource table includes the generated unique IDs along with the configurations supported for the app. Additionally, the Resource table also includes the raw values for primitive (scalar) resources such as strings, integers, booleans, colors, and dimensions.
  - Android Studio can parse and display the content of resources.arsc in human readable format. In Android Studio, select Build > Analyze APK... > Select app-debug.apk > Select resources.arsc in the app-debug.apk window.

  - Android tracks resources using the unique integer ID generated for each resource by AAPT. These unique integer IDs are 32-bit signed integers with the following format: 0xPPTTEEEE
    - PP: packageId. For your app, this packageId always 0x7f (TODO: Is this always the case for multiDexEnabled builds?). For system resources (e.g android.R.color.holo_red_dark), this packageId is always 1.
    - TT: typeId. A typeId is assigned to each resource type - attr, bool, color, dimen, layout, string, etc...
    - EEEE: entryId, the actual ID of the resource.
